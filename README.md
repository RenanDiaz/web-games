### Among Us Party
A real-life party game inspired by Among Us. Use this app to secretly assign roles to players and track scores.

**How to play:**
1. **Setup**: Enter a 4-digit PIN, choose the number of impostors, and add all players
2. **Role Check**: Each player selects their name and enters the PIN to see their role privately
3. **Play**: Play the real-life game however you like (hide and seek, tasks, discussions, voting)
4. **End Round**: Record who won (Crewmates or Impostors) and start a new round

**Features:**
- Secret role assignment with PIN protection
- Support for 1-3 impostors
- Score tracking across multiple rounds
- Player statistics (times as impostor/crewmate, win rates)
- Game state saved in browser (survives page refresh)
